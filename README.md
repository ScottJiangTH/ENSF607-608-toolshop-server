### Implementation
##### Change Note  
1. Let ModelController class implement runnable. Reason: when ServerController started running multiple thread, multiple sets of ModelController+DBController+Model has to be constructed. 
2. Deleted Shop class, Model class aggregates Inventory, SupplierList, and CustomerList classes. Reason: Model act as the class who directly interacts with ModelController has to have all methods related to all operations in Item, Supplier, Customer class. This will render Shop class serving no purpose but as a shell class that allows all calls passing through it.
3. Changed the Item class variable Supplier theSupplier into int supplierId, because two object with two way association relationship is not able to be serialized to JSON. [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27926794/jackson-and-serialization)

##### Design Note
1. To minimize interaction with DB, in Model constructor, it reads all supplier, item and client lists from DB and store info in local. This is under the assumption that database size is small. If database size increases dramatically, this has to be changed into a query-on-demand manner.

### Instructions on How to Run this Program
1. Include SQL jar file into classpath.
2. At server side: [Include JACKSON jar file into classpath.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2RBO_9wjYg)
3. At client side: [Include official JSON jar file into classpath.](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java)
